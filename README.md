> Full Stack final Capstone project for NSS

## Project Proposal
A website for those interested in video games and/or the video gaming industry to be engaged in the community and to stay informed as consumers and creatives. Share and discover blogs posts or review articles; stay up-to-date with trends; discover games from people just like you who enjoy knowing about whatâ€™s going on in the industry.


## Project Requirements Included
* Construct a database schema for use throughout the project
* Create a responsive web-app
* Be able to create, read, update, and delete content that effects the databse
* Front-end and back-end must communicate back-and-forth to handle queries and executables


## Technologies, Frameworks, and Languages Used
* .NET Core WebAPI (C#)
* SQL Server Management Studio (T-SQL)
* Angular 4 (TypeScript & Javascript)
* Bootstrap 3 (HTML & CSS)


## Other Things Used
* Trello: project planning
* Draw.io: building an ERD to visualize the database model
* Coffee: without caffine this project might not exist


## Final Result
A simple user interface focused on being a place for the user to organize content they have found accross the web as well as see content others share.
  
This full CRUD app allows a user to do the following:
1. Create content with a link and a description
2. Create a 'board' with a title and description for content to be saved to
3. See all content posted, or content only you have posted
4. See boards other users have created
5. Update titles, descriptions, links, and visibility settings of content and boards
6. Delete content and boards that you created that you no longer desire to be on the site


## V2.0 and Beyond
* Search functionality
* Users can assign keywords to content so that content can further be labeled and more easily searched for
* Impliment SMMRY to optionally summarize an article to add more information to content in addition to user entered descriptions
* A Chrome extension for the web-app. Add content when you're away from this site; for when you see content that you want to share
